        <li class="bodytext1">Australia, officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country
            comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller
            islands.[12] It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The
            population of 26 million[6] (53 place in the world) is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the
            eastern seaboard.[13] Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The country's other
            major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.</li>
        <li class="bodytext2">Bangkok[a] is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as Krung
            Thep Maha Nakhon[b] or simply Krung Thep.[c] The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in
            the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has an estimated population of 10.539 million as of
            2020, 15.3 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the
            surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census, making Bangkok an extreme primate city, dwarfing
            Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.</li>
