        Australia, officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, is a
        sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent,
        the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.[12] It is the
        largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by
        total area. The population of 26 million[6] (53 place in the world) is
        highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[13]
        Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The
        country's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth,
        and Adelaide.

        Bangkok[a] is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is
        known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon[b] or simply Krung Thep.[c] The
        city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya
        River delta in central Thailand and has an estimated population of
        10.539 million as of 2020, 15.3 percent of the country's population.
        Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding
        Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census, making Bangkok an
        extreme primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both
        size and importance to the national economy.

        Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎, romanized: Dubayy [dʊˈbajj], Gulf
        Arabic pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous city in the United
        Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.[5][6][7]
        Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the
        Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia.[8] It
        is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.[9] Oil
        revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already
        a major mercantile hub. Dubai's oil output made up 2.1 percent of the
        Persian Gulf emirate's economy in 2008.[10] A centre for regional and
        international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies
        on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial
        services.[11][12][13][14] According to government data, the population
        of Dubai is estimated at around 3,400,800 as of 8 September
        2020.[15][16]
